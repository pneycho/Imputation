# Imputation

This is an implementation of "Effective Missing Data Prediction for Collaborative Filtering" so if you use the code, you must cite

> Hao Ma, Irwin King and Michael R. Lyu, "Effective Missing Data Prediction for Collaborative Filtering", SIGIR 2007 Proceedings.

So this code imputes missing values in the sparse matrix of ratings data using collaborative filtering.

How to run:-

1. Open the file Imputation.ipynb on Jupyter Notebook 
2. Change the filepath to your dataset. This one was used on the MovieLens 100K dataset.
3. Run the code.
